# Functionalties
RD Plot is a plotting tool for visualizing rate-distortion data parsed from  
encoder log files of common video coding reference software packages.  
It can:
- Display rate-distortion plots
- Select component to be plotted (YUV, Y, U, V and even more)
- Plot rd plot over time (rate over time, psnr over time)
- Exporting plots (through matplotlib interface)
- Calculate and display table of bjontegaard delta measurement
- Export tables as latex style table code

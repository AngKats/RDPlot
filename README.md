This project implements a GUI for displaying rd-plots of encoded video sequences.

Functionalties (which will be developed)
- Display rd plots
- Select component to be plotted (YUV, Y,U,V)
- Add multiple plot widgets, change between them
- Open single encoder logs
- Open whole directories, parsing all found plots
- A GUI for importing logs, which scan the filesystem under a selected directory
- Plot rd plot over time (rate over time, psnr over time, or 3d rd-time)
- Exporting plots (through matplotlib interface)
- Display table of rd results
- export tables as latex style table code
